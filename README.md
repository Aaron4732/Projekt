# Projekt
# Battleships 

How to start the game:
Go to the Main class, start the main method and follow the instructions in the console.
Thats it! :)


# Short game instruction
At the beginning of the game player1 and player2 have to place their ships.
The game asks you about the coordinates and the direction for the ships. 
!Warning! If the ship doesn't fit, the game asks you again.
For the shots the same system is in use as for placing the ships.

# Now, destroy every ship of your enemy. Show no mercy & destroy everything in sight!!!
